# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm using:
1. Adjacency List representation.
2. Adjacency Matrix representation.

## Objectives

- Calculates the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- Visualizes the graph with labeled shortest distances.

## Libraries Used

- Python
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Heapq (for priority queue)
